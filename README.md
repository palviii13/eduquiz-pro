# Mission Quizify

Welcome to the **Mission Quizify** project! This repository contains the implementation of a quiz generation and PDF chat application using Streamlit and Langchain, integrated with Google Cloud's VertexAI. The project is divided into several tasks, each building upon the previous one to create a robust system for quiz generation and interactive PDF content querying.

## Introduction

Mission Quizify is an interactive application designed to allow users to upload PDF documents, generate quizzes based on the content, and interactively chat with the PDF content. This project leverages Streamlit for the web interface and integrates Langchain and Google Cloud's VertexAI for advanced NLP capabilities.

This project was completed as part of the [Radical AI app](https://ai.radicalai.app/Gemini-Quizify-2024-Feb-28) mission, where participants are challenged to build innovative AI applications.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 3: PDF Processing

**File:** `tasks/task_3/task_3.py`

This task involves creating a `DocumentProcessor` class that processes uploaded PDF documents using Langchain's `PyPDFLoader`. It extracts the pages from the PDFs and displays the total number of pages processed.

### Task 4: Embedding Client

**File:** `tasks/task_4/task_4.py`

The `EmbeddingClient` class is initialized to connect to Google Cloud's VertexAI for text embeddings. It handles embedding queries and documents using the specified model.

### Task 5: Chroma Collection Creator

**File:** `tasks/task_5/task_5.py`

The `ChromaCollectionCreator` class creates a Chroma collection from the documents processed by the `DocumentProcessor`. It splits the documents into text chunks and indexes them using the embedding model.

### Task 6: Quiz Builder

**File:** `tasks/task_6/task_6.py`

This task involves building a `Quiz Builder` application with Streamlit. It uses the `DocumentProcessor`, `EmbeddingClient`, and `ChromaCollectionCreator` to allow users to upload documents, specify a quiz topic, and generate quizzes.

### Task 7: Quiz Generator

**File:** `tasks/task_7/task_7.py`

The `QuizGenerator` class is designed to generate quiz questions based on the topic provided. It integrates with the vectorstore to retrieve relevant context and uses the LLM to generate structured quiz questions in JSON format.

### Task 8: Quiz Generation and Validation

**File:** `tasks/task_8/task_8.py`

This task extends the `QuizGenerator` class to validate the uniqueness of generated quiz questions and compile a list of unique questions for the quiz. It includes methods for question generation and validation.

### Task 9: Quiz Manager

**File:** `tasks/task_9/task_9.py`

The `QuizManager` class is responsible for managing the quiz questions. It includes methods to navigate through the quiz, retrieve specific questions by index, and handle quiz operations.

### Task 10: Complete Quiz Application

**File:** `tasks/task_10/task_10.py`

This task integrates all previous tasks to create a complete quiz application. It includes the entire workflow from PDF uploading, processing, quiz generation, and quiz management using Streamlit.

### Task 11: Chat with PDF

**File:** `tasks/task_11/task_11.py`

The final task adds a `ChatWithPDF` feature that allows users to interactively ask questions about the PDF content. It integrates the previously created components and uses the LLM to provide concise answers based on the PDF content.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mission-quizify.git
   cd mission-quizify
  
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the Streamlit application:**

  ```
streamlit run tasks/task_11/task_11.py
```

### Google Cloud Setup

1. Create a Google Cloud Project:

- Go to the Google Cloud Console.
- Click on the project drop-down and select "New Project".
- Give your project a name and click "Create".

2. Enable Vertex AI API:

- In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library".
- Search for "Vertex AI" and click on "Enable".
- Set up Authentication:

3. Install the Google Cloud SDK.

- Authenticate your SDK installation with your Google account:
```
gcloud auth login
```

3. Set your project in the SDK:
```
gcloud config set project your-project-id
```

4. Download Service Account Key:

- Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts".
- Select your project and click "Create Service Account".
- Create a key and download the JSON file.
- Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of the JSON file:
```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
```
- make sure you add Project ID and location details in the code.

## Usage

1. **Upload PDF Documents:**
   Use the interface to upload PDF documents and process them.

2. **Generate Quizzes:**
